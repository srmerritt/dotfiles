# Context lets you quickly switch between different shell profiles. The
# contexts are stored under ~/.context, and there's a simple wrapper, 'ctx',
# to manage them.
#
# An example usage would be different development environments, where it's
# desirable for all new terminal windows to open in the environment's root
# directory. To switch the environment, and therefore the directory each new
# window begins in, the user would use 'ctx set <name>', provided that '<name>'
# has previously been defined with 'ctx new <name>'.
